# IMB Data Analyst Proffesional Certificate on  Coursera
Over the past few months, I've immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum that delved deep into data analysis, providing me with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in the world of data. 📈💻

This program covered a wide range of topics, from data mining and cleaning to data wrangling, data analysis and data visualization.

The program introduced me to a variety of tools and techniques, including Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Plotly Dash. These skills have proven invaluable in real-world data analysis projects.

As a part of the Certificate I completed 9 sub-courses, including “Python for Data Science, AI & Development”, “Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python” and “Data Visualization with Python”.
This certificate is just the beginning of my data analytics journey. I'm committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and expanding my skill set even further.

I'm eager to apply my newfound knowledge and skills to real-world projects and contribute to data-driven decision-making in my field. If you have any opportunities or projects where I can leverage my data analysis expertise, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I look forward to continuing to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in the field of data analysis.
